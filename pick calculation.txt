Create array with pick[0] finisher[1] ... compare the two, if they match then 10 points
If they don't compare, find out where the pick actually finished.

Full Points for a pick:
You'll get the full 10 points for each exact pick. Example: You pick Kimi to come in 3rd, and Kimi finishes in 3rd place, so, you get 10 points for that pick.

Partial Points for a pick:
You'll get partial points for each of your picks that finish in the Top 10. The formula is as follows:

10 (Full Points) minus (-) the difference between your pick and the actual placing of that driver.

Example: You pick Kimi to finish in 4th place. Kimi actually finishes in 2nd place. So, 4th place minus (-) 2nd place is 2, (4 - 2 = 2), which is the difference between your pick and the placing of that driver. Your score for that pick would be 8 points, (10 - 2 = 8).
